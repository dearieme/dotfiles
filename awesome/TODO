Want to try and encapsulate the following scheme in rules, it would be nice if
it dynamically adjusted to screens being attached and detached

1 screen present:

* 一 - tmux ide session
* 二 - chromium (wcn)
* 三 - 2 chromium (monitor + graphs)
* 四 - tmux ide (personal)
* 五 - chromium (personal)

2 screens:

Left

* 一 - chromium (wcn)
* 二 - spare
* 三 - spare
 
Right

* 一 - tmux ide session
* 二 - spare
* 三 - 2 chromium (monitor + graphs)
* 四 - tmux ide (personal)
* 五 - chromium (personal)

Misc
----

* Key binding to bring up logout options box
* Alternative to nm-applet - it is very resource hungry, seriously, why does
  it consume four times as much memory as the window manager

Bugs
----

* Keypad numbers don't behave as numbers for tag selection
* Polkit issue on restart
